Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Yes. All three model architectures classified the breed to be the same breed. ("labrador retriever" in my case.)


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes. All three model architectures classified the breed of Dog_02.jpg to be 	the same as the breed of Dog_01.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes. All three model architectures classified both Lion_01.jpg as "not-a-dog" and Flower_vase_01.jpg as "not-a-dog". 



4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

All three models classified Line_01.jpg as a 'lion'. 

But only restnet and vgg model architectures classified Flower_vase_01.jpg to be a 'vase'. 
Alexnet model classified it as "cauliflower". But actually that is an image of a vase of white roses.
Hence, the accuracy of the Alexnet model is somewhat unreliable.

Out of other two models, Restnet model architecture took the least elapsed time for
this operation. Vgg model took about 3 seconds for the task. It has taken about 
3 times higher than the time that Restnet took for the same operation.
